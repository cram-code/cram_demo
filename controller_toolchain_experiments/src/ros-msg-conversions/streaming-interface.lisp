;;; IDEA BEHIND ROS STREAMERS:
;;;
;;;   Certain setups, e.g. controllers, image segmentation, call for a ROS
;;;   setup with a single topic in and a single topic out connection. I'd like
;;;   to refer to this as a streaming application:
;;;
;;;                 -----------------
;;;   /in_topic --> | STREAMING APP | --> /out_topic
;;;                 -----------------
;;;
;;;   Internally, the streaming application itself typically consists of 3 steps:
;;;     (1) convert the ROS message into another LISP object
;;;     (2) apply a function on this object
;;;     (3) convert the result of that computation back to a ROS message
;;;
;;;   I call this the callback of the stream which is sandwiched between a subscriber
;;;   and a publisher. This file provides functionality to describe ROS topic
;;;   connections, and create/start/stop ROS streamers.
;;;
;;;   A quick example:
;;;
;;;     (let ((in-descr
;;;             (make-ros-topic-description
;;;              :lisp-package "std_msgs-msg"
;;;              :msg-type "float64"
;;;              :topic "in_topic"))
;;;           (out-descr
;;;             (make-ros-topic-description
;;;              :lisp-package "std_msgs-msg"
;;;              :msg-type "string"
;;;              :topic "out_topic")))
;;;       (defparameter *streamer* 
;;;         (make-ros-streamer :in-topic-descr in-descr 
;;;                            :out-topic-descr out-descr 
;;;                            :function #'prin1-to-string)))
;;;
;;;     (start-ros-streamer *streamer*)
;;;     (ros-streamer-up-p *streamer*)
;;;       --> T
;;;
;;;     Meanwhile, the stream is running. One can analyse the setup from
;;;     the console:
;;;       rostopic echo /out_topic
;;;       rostopic pub /in_topic std_msgs/Float64 "ata: 1.0}"
;;;
;;;     (stop-ros-streamer *streamer*)
;;;     (ros-streamer-running-p *streamer*)
;;;       --> NIL
;;;
;;;     Now, all topics are down:
;;;       rostopic list
;;;
